## Brief

For this exercise, we will be designing a product catalog.

The product catalog is a customer facing application. A typical customer will browse through several products in a same category and apply some filtering to narrow down their selection.

Build web application with the following specification:

* It stores product information, which involves a product name, description and price in SGD.
* It provides a listing of all products through a UI
* An admin interface should be available for configuration of products.
* Create a simple model and respective controller(s) to present the information.

Do not implement anything related to authentication or product checkout as it is not part of this exercise.

To simplify the setting up process on our end, please use:

- Ruby on Rails ~> 4.2

- PostgreSQL >= 9.3

You are free to use any gems or architectural support as you see fit.

Your solution will be accessed based on the following criteria:

1. Readability. This includes tests that well documents the behavior

2. Performance

3. Modularity and Separation of Concerns

4. Database integrity

Please share a link to the git repository with us upon completion.

Happy coding!
